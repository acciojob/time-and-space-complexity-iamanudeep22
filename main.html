	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the efficient time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the sum of auxiliary space and the memory used by input variables. Space complexity is the parallel concept to time complexity. For example, if we want to initialize an array of n integers, then its space complexity would be O(n).</p>
